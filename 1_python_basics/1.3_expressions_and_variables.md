## Expresssions vs Statements
* **Expressions** Evaluate to something, for example `x + 2`.  
  Expressions may include combinations of values, variables, operators and calls to functions.

* **Statements** Do something, for example `print(x)`  
  Statements represent an action or command e.g print statements, assignment statement.  
  Statements are generally made up of expressions.

### Expressions  
*Expressions describe a type of operation that computers perform.*  

Expressions in Python can include operations among compatible types (e.g. integers and floats). For example, basic arithmetic operations  
<details><summary>Addition operation expression</summary>

`43 + 60 + 16 + 41`  
</details>

<details><summary>Subtraction operation expression</summary>
 
`50 - 60`  
</details>

<details><summary>Multiplication operation expression</summary>

`5 * 5`  
</details>

<details><summary>Division operation expression</summary>

`25 / 5`  
</details>

<details><summary>Floor division operation expression</summary>

The double slash performs floor division, where the result is rounded down to the nearest integer:  
`25 // 4`  
</details>

<details><summary>Modulo</summary>

The `%` operator in Python is called the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. For example `3 % 2` will return "1".

A common context in which this is used is checking for odd or even numbers, the modulo operator is used to check if a number is divisible by 2.
```py
if number % 2 != 0: # Will return True if the number is odd
```
[Code](/code_snips/1.3.3_even_or_odd.py)  
*See [Loops](/3_flow_control/3.2_loops.md) for loop information.*

**Note:** Python follows mathematical conventions when performing mathematical expressions (*BODMAS*).  

### Statements
A number of statements have already been introduced, such as `print()` and `type()`.
Below is a collection of some others for reference.  

#### Advanced Removal methods for Python Collections

Python offers several ways to remove elements or references to data, depending on the context. These include:

| **Method**           | **Use Case**                                 | **Target** | **Key Difference**                                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `del`                | Delete references or by key/index            | L, T, D    | Deletes references, including entire variables, tuples, or dictionary entries without returning the deleted value. |
| `remove()`           | Remove specific value                        | L, S       | Removes the first occurrence of a specific value, throws an error if absent.    |
| `pop()`              | Remove and return value                      | L, S, D    | Removes and returns the value. For dictionaries, removes by key, returning the value.                               |
| `clear()`            | Empty the container                          | L, S, D    | Empties the container but keeps the container intact (can’t be used on tuples). |
| `discard()`          | Remove value (no error if absent)            | S          | Does not raise an error if the value is absent.                                 |
| `difference_update()`| Remove elements found in another iterable    | S          | Removes all elements found in another iterable, modifies the set in place.      |
| `tuple slicing`      | Create a new tuple without specific elements | T          | Used to 'remove' elements by creating a new tuple. Tuples are immutable, so slicing produces a modified version. |

**KEY:**
- **L**: Lists
- **T**: Tuples
- **S**: Sets
- **D**: Dictionaries

<details><summary>del() Statement</summary>

The `del()` (delete) statement can be used with [lists](/2_python_data_structures/2.1_lists_and_tuples.md#delete), [dictionaries](/2_python_data_structures/2.3_dictionaries.md#delete) and entire variables. While it cannot delete elements from a [tuple](/2_python_data_structures/2.1_lists_and_tuples.md#concatenation-and-immutability) because tuples are immutable, it can be used to remove an entire tuple.  
Delete (unlinke remove) does not return the deleted value.   
The `del()` statement deletes a reference to an object, or the reference to the element specified by key/index. if no references remain the object/element is garbage collected.  
</details>

<details><summary>remove() Method</summary>

The `remove()` method is used specifically on [lists](/2_python_data_structures/2.1_lists_and_tuples.md#remove), it removes the first occurrence of a specific value from a list. Being a method, `remove()` operates on values in place.  
The `remove()` method will also work on [sets](/2_python_data_structures/2.2_sets.md#remove), however it's limitation of only removing a single value at a time, and the fact that it will throw a `KeyError` if a value isn't present in the set makes it less preferred.
</details>

<details><summary>pop() Method</summary>

The `pop()` method is similar to `del()` in that it will remove an element referred to by index/key from a [list](/2_python_data_structures/2.1_lists_and_tuples.md#pop) or [dictionary](/2_python_data_structures/2.3_dictionaries.md#pop), however it will also return the removed element. `pop()` will also remove elements from [sets](/2_python_data_structures/2.2_sets.md#pop); because sets are unordered and do not hae indexes or keys the removed element will be seemingly random, but the element is still returned.
</details>

<details><summary>clear() Method</summary>

The `clear()` method will remove all elements of a [list](/2_python_data_structures/2.1_lists_and_tuples.md#clear), [set](/2_python_data_structures/2.2_sets.md#clear) or [dictionary](/2_python_data_structures/2.3_dictionaries.md#clear), leaving the container empty without removing it. Unlike `del()` it will empty the container but leave the variable intact. `clear()` will not work with tuples as they are immutable.
</details>

<details><summary>discard() Method</summary>

The `discard()` method is unique to [sets](/2_python_data_structures/2.2_sets.md#discard). It does much the same as `remove()` except that if the item to be removed does not exist in the set, `discard()` will handle it silently.
</details>

<details><summary>difference_update() Method</summary>

The `difference_update()` method is unique to [sets](/2_python_data_structures/2.2_sets.md#difference-update). It will remove multiple elements at once. Alternatively the subtraction operator `-` can be used. Note that `difference_update()` modifies the set in place, whereas subtraction creates a new set. 
</details>

<details><summary>Tuple Slicing</summary>

While [tuple slicing](/2_python_data_structures/2.1_lists_and_tuples.md#slicing) is not strictly a removal method, it is a means of 'removing' values from tuples (which are [immutable](/2_python_data_structures/2.1_lists_and_tuples.md#concatenation-and-immutability)) by taking the parts of a tuple that are to be kept and creating a new tuple (as well as allowing items to be 'added' to the new tuple.)
</details>


## Variables
Variables are pointers to a particular area of memory. They are used to avoid repeating [expressions](#expressions), however they can be the resuly of an expression.

The expression `2 * 3` evaluates to `6`, this can be assigned to a variable using the assignment operator (equals sign):
```py
number = 2 * 3
```

The assignment operator `=` evaluates the expression on the right and assigns it to the left.  
If necessary [string](/1_python_basics/1.2_types.md#types) variables can be stored on multiple lines by using 3 quotes `'''`:
```py
mary = '''\
Mary Had a Little Lamb\n
Mary had a little lamb,
Little lamb, little lamb,
Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow.\n
And everywhere that Mary went,
Mary went, Mary went,
Everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go."
'''
```
Note that variables cannot be literals. Literals are syntax that is used to epress a fixed value of a specific data type. These include thigs like numbers and operators. for example `5 = 10` is invalid, but `five = 10` is not.

Operations can be performed on variables the result saved to a new variable
```py
# Use another variable to store the result of the operation between variable and value 
y = x / 60
```

If a value is saved to an existing variable; the new value will overwrite the previous value
```py
my_variable = my_variable / 60
```
*It's good practice to use meaningful variable names, to improve code readability and maintainability, the Python PEP8 standard also indicates that variable names should be in snake_case.*

___
### Variables from user input
Variables can be derived from a user input which then be used elsewhere by recalling the (exact) name of the variable.  
```py
# Request User input
name = input("Hi, What's your name? ")

# Recall the variable
print ("Hi",name,"it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)")
```
[Code](<../Code Snips/1.3.1 Variables from user input.py>)

Will output:  
```
Hi, What's your name? Amanda
Hi Amanda it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)
```

*In Python, variables derived from the `input()` function are treated as a string by default.*  

If comparing a user input variable to numerical values, the input must be converted to an integer using the `int()` function. See [Type Casting](/1_python_basics/1.2_types.md#type-casting) for more information.  
 
<details><summary><i>See below for an illustration of what happens if input variables are not correctly converted</i></summary>

Script to return an answer depending on a user's input:  

**Incorrect:**
```py
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```
In this case, age is a string. When attempting to compare it with integers using  the `<=` operator, Python throws an error.

To fix this, `age` must be converted to an integer:  
**Correct**  
```py
# Request user input and onvert to integer
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```

This ensures that age is treated as an integer, allowing numerical comparisons without raising a `TypeError`.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a script that takes a temperature in Celsius as user input and converts it to Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is: `F=95×C+32`  
Ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, perform the conversion, and print the result.  

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
## Conversion from Celsius to Farenheit
degree_sign = u"\u00b0"
# Request input
temp = input ("What is the Celsius temperature that you would like to convert to Fahrenheit? ")

# Convert input temp to float
float_temp = float(temp)

# Convert the temp into farenheight
farenheit = (9/5) * float_temp + 32 

# Print the tempertaure in farenheight
print (temp, degree_sign, "C Is " ,farenheit ,degree_sign,"F")

```
