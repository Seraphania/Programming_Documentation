## Lists and Tuples
*Lists are mutable and can be changed. Tuples are fixed.*

Both lists and tuples are ordered data types (can be iterated over), are sequential, can contain multiple *types* and can be accessed via an index reference. Both are compound data types - data made up of multiple values or data types.  

The main difference between the two is that lists can be modified, whereas tuples cannot. This makes lists more flexible, however ~~tuples are more memory efficient~~, making them the better option where the data will not need to change.

___
## Tuples
Tuples are an ordered sequence, they are very much like strings, except that unlike strings each element can contain multiple characters (different elements may be different types), rather than each character being an element, and they are immutable; they cannot be modified.

Tuples are expressed as comma-separated elements within parentheses. These elements can be of different types (string, float, integer etc.), but the type of the variable is tuple.  
Example tuple with string, integer and float.
```py
tuple = ("disco", 10, 1.2)

# Print the tuple
print(tuple)

# Print the type of the tuple
type(tuple)
```

Will output:  
```
('disco', 10, 1.2)
<class 'tuple'>
```
___
### Types
The type of a tuple is `tuple`, however each element within a tuple may have its own [type](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.2%20Types.md).

**tuple:**
|  **Element:**  |  "disco"  |    10    |    1.2    |
|----------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
|   **Type:**    |  string   |   int    |   float   |

The type of individual element can be printed:
```py
tuple = ("disco", 10, 1.2, True)

# Print the type of value on each index
print(type(tuple[0]))
print(type(tuple[1]))
print(type(tuple[2]))
print(type(tuple[3]))
```

Will output:  
```
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
```

___
### Indexing
As with [string indexing](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.4%20String%20Operations.md#indexing) the elements of a tuple can be accessed by the name of the tuple followed by a square bracket with the index number, negative indexing can also be used.

**tuple:**
|  **Element:**  |  "disco"  |    10    |    1.2    |
|----------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
|  **Index:**    |     0     |    1     |     2     |

```py
tuple = ("disco", 10, 1.2)

# Print the variable on different indexes
print(tuple[0])
print(tuple[1])
print(tuple[-1])
```

Will output:
```
disco
10
1.2
```

**Length**  
We can use the `len()` command to obtain the length of a tuple:
```py
tuple = ("disco", 10, 1.2)

# Print the length of the tuple
print(len(tuple))
```

Will output:
```
3
```

___
### Slicing
Like strings, tuples can be [sliced](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.4%20String%20Operations.md#slicing), to obtain multiple elements from a tuple the staring index is referenced, followed by the ending index +1, for example:
**tuple:**
|  **Element:**  |  "disco"  |    10    |    1.2    |
|----------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
|  **Index:**    |     0     |    1     |     2     |

```py
tuple = ("disco", 10, 1.2)

# Slice from index 0 to index 2 (i.e. take the first 2 elements)
tuple1[0:2]

```

Will output:
```
('disco', 10)
```

___
### Stride
Stride values can be used on tuples in the same was as [strings](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.4%20String%20Operations.md#stride) by following the required index range with the stride value:
**tuple1:**
|  **Element:**  | "disco" |  10  |  1.2  | "Cat" |  17.3  |  True  |
|----------------|---------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
|  **Index:**    |    0    |  1   |   2   |   3   |   4    |   5    |

```py
tuple1 = ("disco", 10, 1.2, "Cat", 17.3, True)

# Print every second element of the tuple
tuple1[0 : len(tuple1)+1 : 2]
```

Will output:
```
('disco', 1.2, 17.3)
```

[Loops *Needs Update 3.2](/x3%20Python%20Programming%20Fundamentals/x3.2%20Loops.md) can also be used to iterate through tuples.

___
### Concatenation and immutability
As with [string concatenation](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.4%20String%20Operations.md#concatenate-strings) tuples can be concatenated using the `+` sign:
```py
# Concatenate two tuples
tuple = tuple1 + ("Cat", 17.3, True)
print(tuple1)
```
Will output:
```
('disco', 10, 1.2, 'Cat', 17.3, True)
```

Tuples are immutable so they can't be modified directly. In order to "modify" the content of a tuple, a new tuple must be created. This can be done by replacing the tuple with a new one:
```py 
tuple = ("disco", 10, 1.2)
print("Original tuple: ", tuple)

# Replace 'tuple' with new 'tuple'
tuple = tuple + ("Cat", 17.3, True)
print("New tuple: ", tuple)
```
Will output:
```
Original tuple:  ('disco', 10, 1.2)
New tuple:  ('disco', 10, 1.2, 'Cat', 17.3, True)
```
*Note that only tuples or parts of tuples (slices) can be concatenated!*

If part of a tuple is to be modified, slicing can be used to take the parts of the tuple to be retained; and the new element inserted. This is then assigned to a new tuple (even if the new tuple is named the same as the old one.)
```py 
tuple = ('disco', 10, 1.2, 'Cat', 17.3, True)
print("Original tuple: ", tuple)

# Replace the element 'Cat' with 'Dog'
tuple1 = (tuple[0:3] + ("Dog",) + tuple[4:7])
print("New tuple: ", tuple1)
```
Will output:
```
Original tuple:  ('disco', 10, 1.2, 'Cat', 17.3, True)
New tuple:  ('disco', 10, 1.2, 'Dog', 17.3, True)
```

*Note that `("Dog")` is a string, and cannot be concatenated with the tuple slices. While placing a comma after `"Dog"` within parentheses, makes it a tuple: `("Dog",)`*
```py
a = "Dog"
b = ("Dog")
c = ("Dog",)
type(a)
<class 'str'>

type(b)
<class 'str'>

type(c)
<class 'tuple'>
```

___
### Tuple Sorting
As a consequence of immutability, manipulating a tuple requires creating a new tuple instead. The `sorted()` function leverages this, where the original tuple is read, the elements sorted and the result returned to a new tuple:
```py
# A sample tuple
Ratings = (0, 9, 6, 5, 10, 8, 9, 6, 2)

# Sort the tuple
RatingsSorted = sorted(Ratings)
RatingsSorted
```

Will output:
```
[0, 2, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 10]
```

The `sorted()` function is highly flexible, but it requires the elements to be comparable (See [Types](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.2%20Types.md#types) for more information on comparability). For mixed or custom types, explicit sorting logic must be provided, for example using length:
```py
words = ["apple", "fig", "cherry"]
sorted(words) # Alphabetical (default) sort
sorted(words, key=len) # Sort by word length
```

Will output:
```
['apple', 'cherry', 'fig']
['fig', 'apple', 'cherry']
```

#### Functions and Methods:
* **Functions:** like `(sorted(iterable))` are general-purpose and return new objects. See [Tuple Sorting](#tuple-sorting) above for an example.
* **Methods:** like `(list.method())` modify the object they belong to. See [List Sorting](#list-sorting) below for an example.
* **Statements:** like `del`, assignment (`=`), conditional statements (`if`, `else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and `pass`; perform an action but do not return a value. They are generally executed as part of a program's flow.

See [Return vs Modify](#return-vs-modify) below for an illustration of how this impacts code.
___
### Nesting  
A tuple can contain other tuples as well as other complex data types; this is called nesting. These elements can be accessed using standard indexing methods.  

**NestedT:**
|  **Element:**  | "1" |  2  | "pop", "rock"  | 3, 4 | "disco", (1, 2)  |
|----------------|-----|-----|----------------|------|------------------|
|  **Index:**    |  0  |  1  |        2       |  3   |         4        |

```py
NestedT =(1, 2, ("pop", "rock") ,(3,4),("disco",(1,2)))

# Print element on each index
print("Element 0 of Tuple: ", NestedT[0])
print("Element 1 of Tuple: ", NestedT[1])
print("Element 2 of Tuple: ", NestedT[2])
print("Element 3 of Tuple: ", NestedT[3])
print("Element 4 of Tuple: ", NestedT[4])
```

Will output:
```
Element 0 of Tuple:  1
Element 1 of Tuple:  2
Element 2 of Tuple:  ('pop', 'rock')
Element 3 of Tuple:  (3, 4)
Element 4 of Tuple:  ('disco', (1, 2))
```

To access the nested tuples the sub-indexes are referred to, it is useful imagine the indexes as a tree structure:  


```mk
Root/index:
0       ├── 1
1       ├── 2
2       ├── ("pop", "rock")
2.0     │       ├── "pop"
2.1     │       └── "rock"
3       ├── (3, 4)
3.0     │       ├── 3
3.1     │       └── 4
4       └── ("disco", (1, 2))
4.0             ├── "disco"
4.1             └── (1, 2)
4.1.0               ├── 1
4.0.1               └── 2
```

To print these the index address can be referred to
```md
| Full Index     | Value    |
|----------------|----------|
| [0]            | 1        |
| [1]            | 2        |
| [2][0]         | "pop"    |
| [2][1]         | "rock"   |
| [3][0]         | 3        |
| [3][1]         | 4        |
| [4][0]         | "disco"  |
| [4][1][0]      | 1        |
| [4][1][1]      | 22       |
```

```py
NestedT =(1, 2, ("pop", "rock") ,(3,4),("disco",(1,22)))

# Print element on each index, including nest indexes
print("Element 2, 0 of Tuple: ",   NestedT[2][0])
print("Element 2, 1 of Tuple: ",   NestedT[2][1])
print("Element 3, 0 of Tuple: ",   NestedT[3][0])
print("Element 3, 1 of Tuple: ",   NestedT[3][1])
print("Element 4, 0 of Tuple: ",   NestedT[4][0])
print("Element 4, 1 of Tuple: ",   NestedT[4][1])
```

Will output:
```
Element 2, 0 of Tuple:  pop
Element 2, 1 of Tuple:  rock
Element 3, 0 of Tuple:  3
Element 3, 1 of Tuple:  4
Element 4, 0 of Tuple:  disco
Element 4, 1 of Tuple:  (1, 22)
```

Strings in the second nested tuples can be accessed using a third index:
```py
# Print the first element in the second nested tuples
NestedT[2][1][0]

# Print the second element in the second nested tuples
NestedT[2][1][1]
```

Will output:
```
'r'
'o'
```

Similarly, the elements nested deeper in the tree can be accessed with a third index:
```py
# Print the first element in the second nested tuples
NestedT[4][1][0]

# Print the second element in the second nested tuples
NestedT[4][1][1]
```

Will output:
```
1
22
```

```
</details>

___
___
## Lists
Lists are very similar to tuples, the main difference between the two being that lists are mutable (can be modified), whereas tuples cannot be. They can be visually differentiated from tuples as lists are enclosed in square brackets `[]`, unlike tuples which are enclosed in parenthases `()`.
```py
# Create a (nested) list
my_list = [1, 2, ["pop", "rock"] ,[3,4],["disco",[1,2]]]
print(List)
```

Will output:  
```
[1, 2, ('pop', 'rock'), (3, 4), ('disco', (1, 2))]
```

[Types](#types) and [Indexing](#indexing) work in the same way as with tuples, lists can also be [nested](#nesting).

___
### Mutability, 
Lists are mutable, therefore, we can change them, we can apply [methods](#functions-and-methods) that will modify a list in-place, the syntax for this is `object.method()`, for example `list.sort()`

#### Return vs Modify
Using the example below for [list sorting](#list-sorting): `print(list.sort())` will not work.  
This is because methods that modify mutable objects in place (e.g. `list.sort()`) will return the value `None`. This is in order to make the difference between **modifying** and **returning** explicit.  

* The *method* `list.sort()` **modifies** the `list` object 
* The *function* `sorted(list)` will **return** a new sorted `list` object. 

*See [Functions and Methods](#functions-and-methods) above for more information.*

___
## List Operations
Many operations like [index](#indexing), [stride](#stride) and [slicing](#slicing) work in the same way as they do with tuples.

### List Modification
Because lists are mutable they can be modified without the need to create a new list.
```py
# Change the element based on the index
my_list = ["disco", 10, 1.2]
print('Before change:', list)
my_list[0] = 'hard rock'
print('After change:', list)
```

Will output:  
```
Before change: ['disco', 10, 1.2]
After change: ['hard rock', 10, 1.2]
```
___
### List Sorting
The `sorted()` function returns a new list and does not modify the original iterable, which is necessary for immutable output such as tuples. However as lists are mutable see [above](#mutability), an in-place sort can be performed using the `sort()` method *(note that the usual [type](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.2%20Types.md#types) rules apply)*:

```py
my_list = [7, 2, 15]
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)
```

Will output:  
```
[2, 7, 15]
```

___
### Append
The `append()` method adds a single element to the end of a list. The effect of this is that the entire element (which can be a list, string, number, etc.) is added as a single item.
```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Appends a single element (4) to the list
print(my_list)

# Appending another list
my_list.append([5, 6])  # The list [5, 6] is added as a single element
print(my_list)
```

Will output:  
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]
```

*Note that each time a method is applied, the list changes.*

__
### Extend
While similar to [`Append()`](#append), the `extend()` method Adds each element from an iterable (like another list, tuple, string, etc.) to the end of the list, effectively "flattening" the iterable.  
The effect of this is that the individual elements of the iterable are added to the list individually, not as a single item.
```py
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list1.extend([4, 5, 6])  # Adds each element of the list [4, 5, 6] individually
print(list1)

# Extending with a string
list1.extend("abc")  # Adds each character of the string as an individual element
print(list1)
```

Will output:  
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 'a', 'b', 'c']
```
___
### Removal Methods
There are a number of ways to remove elements from lists, see [Advanced Removal Methods](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.3%20Expressions%20and%20Variables.md#advanced-removal-methods) for a comparison of different removal methods.

___
#### Delete
List elements can be deleted using `del`. This is an example of a [statement](#functions-and-methods). `del` will remove any elements in the list indicated by its index reference.
```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print('Before change:', my_list)
del(my_list[3]) # Delete the 4th elemnt of th list (index 3)
print('After change:', my_list)
```

Will output:  
```
Before change: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
After change: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
```

While the `del` statement is the most simple and direct method for removing elements, it is limited, as it can only remove a single element at a time.

___
#### Remove
The `remove()` method is used specifically on lists, it removes the first occurrence of a specific value from a list, it does not work with index references.  
Being a method, `remove()` operates on the values in place.  
It should be noted that `remove()` will only remove a single value at a time and will throw a `ValueError` if a value isn't present. This can be useful for deugging.
```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]
print('Before change:', my_list)
my_list.remove(2) # Remove the first instance of the number 2
print('After change:', my_list)
my_list.remove(7) # Remove the number 7 (which is not in the list)
```

Will output:  
```
Before change: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]
After change: [1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]
ValueError: my_list.remove(x): x not in list
```

#### Pop
The `pop()` method is similar to `del()` in that it will remove a single element referred to by index from a list, however it will also return the removed element.  
If no index is specified `pop()` will remove the last element by default. An `IndexError` will be trown if the specified index does not exist.
```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]
print('Before change:', my_list)
my_list.pop() # Remove the last element of the list
print('After change 1:', my_list)
my_list.pop(2) # Remove the third element of the list
print('After change 2:', my_list)
my_list.pop(7) # Remove the number 7 (which is not in the list)
```

Will output:  
```
Before change: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]
6
After change 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2]
3
After change 2: [1, 2, 4, 5, 2]
IndexError: pop index out of range
```

#### Clear
The `clear()` method will remove all elements of a list, it will empty the container but leave the variable intact.
```py 
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]
my_list.clear() # Empty the list
print(my_list)
```

Will output:  
```
[]
```

___
### Aliasing and Cloning
#### Aliasing
When creating an alias, a new variable name is created that points to the same list in memory. This can be useful when workingi with the same data under different variable names, for example in collaborative code where renaming improves readability.  

*Note: Caution must be used, as changes to one alias will affect the other.*
```py
# Original list
original_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Aliasing
alias_list = original_list

# Modify alias
alias_list.append(4)

# Both lists are affected
print("Original:", original_list)
print("Alias:", alias_list)
```

Will output:  
```
Original: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Alias: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

___
#### Cloning
Cloning or duplicating a list creates an entirely new copy in memory. Changes to one list will not affect the other. This is essential wher it is necessary to modify a list without affecting the original, for example when testing different scenarios or to avoid unintended side effects when passing lists to functions or sharing across code.

**Shallow Copy:**  
Shallow copy will only work on simple (non-nested) lists.
```py
# Original list
original_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Shallow copy
copy_list = original_list[:] # or copy_list = original_list.copy()

# Modify copy
copy_list.append(4)

# Only the copy changes
print("Original:", original_list)
print("Copy:", copy_list)
```

Will output:  
```
Original: [1, 2, 3]
Copy: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Deep Copy:**  
Deep copy is necessary when working with nested lists. The example below illustrates a scenario where this may prove useful.
```py
import copy

# Base configuration
base_config = {
    "settings": {"theme": "dark", "font_size": 12},
    "plugins": ["plugin1", "plugin2"]
}

# Deep copy for user-specific modifications
user_config = copy.deepcopy(base_config)
user_config["settings"]["theme"] = "light"

print("Base Config:", base_config)
