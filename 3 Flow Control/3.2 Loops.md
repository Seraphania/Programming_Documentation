## Range  

The `range()` function is particlarly useful for loops as it generates a sequence of numbers. These can be defined by `range(<start*>, <stop +1>,<step*>)`  
**Note:** start and step parameters are optional.
```py
range(5)
range(2, 7)
range(1, 10, 2)
```

Will Output:
```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

## Loops in Python

Loops are used to perform repeated operations. Python provides two main types of loops:
* **For loops:** Used for a predetermined number of iterations, iterating over sequences like lists or ranges.
* **While loops:** Used for repeated execution based on a condition.

**Comparison: For vs While Loops:**
| Feature   | For Loop                      | While Loop                        | 
|-----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|Iteration  |Fixed sequence or range	    |Condition-based                    |
|Use Case   |When iteration count is known	|When stopping condition is dynamic |
|Example    |Iterating over a list          |Checking for specific conditions   |

___
### For Loops

For loops iterate over a sequence, such as a list, range, or tuple. The `for` loop makes it possible to execute a code block multiple times if the number of times is known or defined.

___
#### Basic Syntax

`for` loops iterate over a sequence, such as a list, range, or tuple:
```py
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Will output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

```py
squares = ['red', 'yellow', 'green']
for square in squares:
    print(square)
```

Will output:
```
red
yellow
green
```

___
#### Iteration

For loops can be used to modify lists throught iteration:
```py
squares = ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']

for i in range(0, 5):
    print("Before square ", i, 'is',  squares[i])
    squares[i] = 'white'
    print("After square ", i, 'is',  squares[i])
```

Will output:
```
Before square  0 is red
After square  0 is white
Before square  1 is yellow
After square  1 is white
Before square  2 is green
After square  2 is white
Before square  3 is purple
After square  3 is white
Before square  4 is blue
After square  4 is white
```

___
#### Enumerating Lists

The `enumerate()` function will access both the index and the value in a list.
```py
colours=['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']

for i, colour in enumerate(colours):
    print(f"Index: {i}, Value: {colour}")
```

Will output:
```
Index: 0, Value: red
Index: 1, Value: yellow
Index: 2, Value: green
Index: 3, Value: purple
Index: 4, Value: blue
```

___
### While Loops

The `while` loop exists as a tool for repeated execution based on a condition. The code block will keep being executed until the given logical condition returns a **False** boolean value.

___
#### Basic Syntax

While loops execute until a condition becomes False:
```py
count = 0
while count <= 5: # Keeps exectuing while the condition is True
    print(count)
    count += 1 # Increment the count by 1; shorthand for counter = counter + 1
```

Will output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

While loops can also be used to iterate through lists, by incremetning the index reference:  
```py
dates = [1982, 1980, 1973, 2000]

i = 0
year = dates[0]

while(year != 1973):    
    print(year)
    i = i + 1
    year = dates[i]
    

print("It took ", i ,"repetitions to get out of loop.")
```

Will output:
```
1982
1980
It took  2 repetitions to get out of loop.
```

___
#### Breaking Loops

Break can be used to exit a loop prematurely where necessary, this is especially useful for [exception handling](/3%20Control%20Flow/3.5%20Exception%20Handling.md)
```py
colors = ['red', 'red', 'purple', 'orange']
new_colors = []

for color in colors:
    if color == 'purple':  # Stop adding colors when encountering 'purple'
        break
    new_colors.append(color)
print(new_colors)
```

Will output:
```
['red', 'red']
```

___

PlayListRatings = [10, 9.5, 10, 8, 7.5, 5, 10, 10]
i = 0
rating = PlayListRatings[0]
while(i < len(PlayListRatings) and rating >= 6):
    print(rating)
    i = i + 1 
    rating = PlayListRatings[i]

**Exercise 6:**  

Write a while loop to copy the strings `'orange'` of the list `squares` to the list `new_squares`. Stop and exit the loop if the value on the list is not `'orange'`:  
`squares = ['orange', 'orange', 'purple', 'blue ', 'orange']`  
`new_squares = []`  

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
squares = ['orange', 'orange', 'purple', 'blue ', 'orange']
new_squares = []
i = 0
while(i < len(squares) and squares[i] == 'orange'):
    new_squares.append(squares[i])
    i = i + 1
print (new_squares)

**Exercise 9:**  

Create a script that takes a user's input for a number and prints the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 12. Use a loop to accomplish this.  
[Code](/XXCode%20Snips/3.2.1%20Multiplication%20Loop.py)

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
# Request input (and check it's an integer)
number = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
counter = 1
#product = number + counter
while counter <= 12:
    #I'm doing 12 times table!
    print(int(number), "x", counter, "=", int(counter*number))
    counter += 1
```
</details>

___
**Exercise 10:**  

Create a script that takes a user's input for the number of elements in a list. Then, ask the user to input each element of the list. Finally, print the elements of the list in reverse order. Use a loop to accomplish this.

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
while True:
    try:
        number = int(input("How many items are in this list? "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter an integer: ")
        
counter = 1
items = []

# Ask for the list items as many times as specified
while counter <= number:
    new_item = input(f"Please enter item number {counter}: ")
 # Keep track of the list items
    items.append(new_item)
    counter += 1
    
#Print the item list in reverse order
items.reverse()
print("Your list in reverse is ", *items, sep = "\n")
```
</details>

___
**Exercise 11:**  

Create a script that generates a list of random numbers (between 1 and 100) of a specified length. Then, use conditionals to categorize the numbers into "even" and "odd" groups. Print the resulting lists.  

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
import random as rand
even = []
odd = []

# Get user input, default to 10 if input is invalid
try:
    length = int(input("Please enter a number of variables: "))
except:
    print("No whole number entered, defaulting to 10")
    length = 11

# Default to 100 entries if user input is too big or small.
if length > 100:
    print("that's a stupid number, I'm dong 100!")
    length = 101
elif length < 0:
    print("that's a stupid number, I'm dong 100!")
    length = 101

# Sort randomly generated numbers
for i in range(1, length):
    num = rand.randint(1, 100)
    if num %2 == 0:
        even.append(num)
    else:
        odd.append(num)
    i += 1

# Print Odd and even lists
print(f"Even numbers are: \n{even}")
print(f"Odd numbers are: \n{odd}")
```
